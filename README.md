### Overview
In this dataset, we are presented with a large number of artwork images and associated attributes of the art. Multiple modalities can be expected and the camera sources are unknown. The photographs are often centered for objects, and in the case where the museum artifact is an entire room, the images are scenic in nature.

Each object is annotated by a single annotator without a verification step. Annotators were advised to add multiple labels from an ontology provided by The Met, and additionally are allowed to add free-form text when they see fit. They were able to view the museum's online collection pages and advised to avoid annotating labels already present. The attributes can relate to what one "sees" in the work or what one infers as the object's "utility."

### File
Files
The filename of each image is its **id**.

    路train.csv gives the attribute_ids for the train images in /train
    
    路/test contains the test images. You must predict the attribute_ids for these images.
    
    路sample_submission.csv contains a submission in the correct format
    
    路labels.csv provides descriptions of the attributes


### Results

It nearly cost 25,000 seconds to finish the training and classifing works and it's a good result of this competiton.
